If you are asking this question, please, please read this before you start asking on forums / facebook. Much of this is my opinion, but this question is very unlikley to give you what you are looking for. Hopefully this blog post will help you understand what you need to be asking, and why. \
\
As an avid hobby photographer, I get asked this question a lot. It's a sensible question to anyone that is new to photography, but the answer is never straight forward.

This is a valid point, but an important distinction need sot be made. When starting in photography there are 5 thing that really matter. I'll break these down as we go through the post.

1. The photographer
2. The camera
3. The lens
4. The subject & composition
5. The environment
6. Post processing



# Where is the start ? 

One of the reasons this question is so difficult for others to answer is that they don't know you. They don't know your background, your experience, what makes you excited about a picture or even why you want to take photos. \
\
If you are going to ask this question online, you will get a much better answer by providing some context. Some good things to mention are

* What is your photography experience ?
* Why are you taking up photography ? 
* What do you want to take photos of ? 
* Where (roughly) do you live ?
* Do you have a budget ? 
* What will you be doing with the images ? Printing ? Facebook ? Instagram ? 

These questions will allow people to provide a much better response to your question. For example, if you live in South West England, have £500 to spend and are obsessed with spiders and have little to no experience then my answer would be very different than if you wanted to do wedding photography. 



# Sidestep meaningless and confusing answers

 I've found many of the answers hypocritical to say the least, and just parroting photography folk lore.  Yes, this will attract much hate but before you respond, ask yourself why you aren't using a camera phone for all your shots ? If you are, then that is awesome and I have maximum respect.\
\
**Full disclosure:** I am just as guilty of this as anyone else, and this post is part of my penance to all the new photographers.

The answers you will see when you are this question will range from 

> "A good camera doesn't make you a good photographer"
>
> "The best camera is the one you have with you"
>
> "It's what is behind the camera that counts"

While these are all very true statements, and meant with good intent, they can often be somewhat misleading. \
\
For example, 

> "Investing in a good camera isn't necessary, but by investing in a decent camera it is unlikely to make you any worse, and will possibly avoid you realising you've bought into a system that means you'll need to trade your kit in when you decide you want to buy better lenses."

Just to be clear, the point being made by the person making the response, it that someone who has spent 20 years doing portraiture photography is going to be able to pick up an entry level camera and do something amazing. They will know what the camera is capable of, they will understand how to get the most from it, they will know how to control the compostion, posing and external lighting to compliment the strengths of that particular camera. \
\
If you are asking the question above, you probably aren't that person. There is nothing wrong with that (I still consider myself to be a beginner), but it doesn't give you the answer you wanted. If it were true that the camera didn't matter why do people spend thousands on camera bodies and even more on lenses ? The reason is that newer cameras provide capabilities that do make a difference. \
\
I can already hear the chants of

> "Eye auto focus is cheating, you won't learn how to focus properly"





As a new photographer, there are only some things you can actually control. Let's work our way through the list. Assuming you have no knowledge of photography, you will need to learn the basics. Personally, I found a combination of just getting out with my camera, and a locla 6 week evening college course really useful. 













* Composition
* Focus
* Focal lengths
* Basic camera and lens care
* Lighting
* Working with people
* Post processing



The lens

The subject

The environment

 If you start learning guitar, you usually learn on accoustic. \
They won't help you on day 1, but a massive part of owning a camera is getting to know it. 

I don't say this without personal experience. I started out with a Nikon d5100 and a tamron 18-300 lens (crop sensor). This is a great camera to start with, I learned a lot about the basics of photography. The basic skills I learned were

A list of stuff:

* Sed posuere consectetur est at lobortis
* Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur
* Sed posuere consectetur est at lobortis

How about an ordered list of stuff:

1. Sed posuere consectetur est at lobortis
2. Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur
3. Sed posuere consectetur est at lobortis

Hopefully, this has demonstrated how simple it is to make a nice looking blog with Hylia.
