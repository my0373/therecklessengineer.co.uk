If you have made it to this site, please, please read this before you take any advice on the internet too seriously. The purpose of this post is to share what i've learned on my photography journey, and hopefully it will help someone else. 

# Why ?

\
One of the main reasons i've chosen to write this, is partly for my own family should they become excited in photography, but also as a kind of penance for bad answers i've given others in the past, and to help others learn from my many (often expensive) mistakes.

I have a niece that is just starting out in the world of photography, and I can already see she has the same excitement I do for the world around her. If bothing else, I want her to have somewhere to start with what I consider an honest (by honest, it's my opinion) on the pitfalls of photography at present. **Lilly** - This is meant for you :)

## Context

\
I am just an average hobby photographer. It's not my main job, and not something i'd ever consider as a living. Mainly becuase I know that "having" to do photography to pay the bills would undermine my reasons for taking it up in the first place. Just for context, I suffer from anxiety and it's very hard to be stressed when you are stood on top of a Welsh mountain with just a camera and coffee flask for company.\
\
Another reason i've chosen photography is that my enthisasm for nature and making art (that very often only I love) from the amazing world around us. As someone that never bothered to learn to draw or paint, the camera is my paintbrush and usually a reflection on what excites me at a particular time. It could be asunrise, a sunset or even just a jumping spider that is watching me eat my breakfast :) 

# Where is the start ?

One of the reasons it is hard for others to guide you is that they probably don't what know what excites you about photography. They don't know your background, your experience, what makes you excited about a picture or why you want to take photographs in the first place. There is no such thing as an unbiased photographer. At the risk of sounding all warm and fluffy, it is very personal and most people will respond with what it means to them, what works for them. That doesn't mean their advice should be ignored, it does however, mean that you should get more than one opinion.\
\
When you choose to ask someone for advice on where to start, you will get a much better answer by providing some context. \
\
Some suggestions that will really help guide others would be

* What is your photography experience ?
* Why are you taking up photography ? 
* What do you want to take photos of ? 
* Where (roughly) do you live ?
* Do you have a budget ? 
* What will you be doing with the images ? Printing ? Facebook ? Instagram ? 

These questions will allow people to provide a much better response to your question. For example, if you live in South West England, have £500 to spend and are obsessed with spiders and have little to no experience then my answer would be very different than if you wanted to do wedding photography. 

# The Internet

The internet is the internet. There is good advice, bad advice and just complete hypocracy. there are egos, there are helpful people and there are trolls. You will need to take everything you read with a pinch of salt, and never ever take it personally.\
\
It is a resource to help make you better, but it can also be incredibly destructive to morale. I want to give you my advice for making the best of it. \
\
The internet has allowed us to quickly share our images, and allow others to share our images (somtimes with or without our permission). You will realise everyone has an opinion, it's up to you to objectivly look at that opinion or critisism.

## Unwritten rules of the internet and photography

At some point in your photography journey, you will end up sharing an image on the internet. There are a few unwritten rules to keep you out of trouble.

1. Thou shall not post anyone elses images without credit
2. Thou shall read the rules of any forum becuase they will be enforced swiftly, and without mercy.
3. If you don't want your photo critiqued, don't post it. This may come as a surprise but not everyone is capable of filtering their feelings towards your photo, even if the forum says "be nice". Expect to be savaged, and learn from any valid constructive criticism.
4. Ignore any criticism that isn't constructive. If someone says "that's rubbish" they should explain why or be ignored. You can't learn from something you don't understand. 

> "That which can be asserted without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence" - Christopher Hitchens

5. If it is a composite image, call it a composite image. Otherwise people will assume you are being dishonest. They will notice and call you out. 



# Criticism

On the face of it, critisism is a really tough thing to hear but it can often be the most important. When I said beforew tat no-one was impartial, I include you. \
\
If you have spent a night freezing cold on top of a mountain, relying on pot noodles slowly cooling coffee from a flask to get that epic sunrise with the mist rising in the valley, you are going to be emotinally attached to that image. It's your creation, you made it, when you see that image you'll remember what you went through to capture it, you'll remember how hard and long you waited for that moment. You'll remember the smell of the grass, the mud all over your boots, the sounds all around you. You'll even remember drive home and stopping for a McDonalds sausage and egg McMuffin and how good it tasted! Not to mention the excitement to see what marvel you'd captured and even then probably a few more hours in photoshop or lightroom tweaking it to make it perfect.

You take that image, crop and frame it just how you want, share it on facebook and then the internet says "I don't like the compositon", "The colours look wrong", "cLeArlY PhoToShoPPed". Then the sinking feeling of only a few likes on a group of 1000'000 people. \
\
It is devastating, it's happened to me, but it is actually a really important part of growing as a photographer. The most important question you MUST ask, no matter how hard is "Why ?". 

> \
> An opinion is just an opinion without evidence - Some chap on the internet. 

Often someone will look at your image and make a decision very quickly if they like it or not, by asking them "why ?" it forces them to examine what bothers them most about it. From an initial meaningless outburst, we can get something to help us.\
\
I'd love to tell you this is easy, but try to keep calm. This is exactly the kind of situation that can become tribal very quickly. Remember, there is value in what that person is saying, they just can't or won't express it in a useful way. 

### My first serious attempt at sharing an image

This was my original image. I was pretty happy with it. It was the end of summer and it was a hot day. Hand held in the middle of a bramble bush with a view of a local landmark that reminds me of home.

Then I decided it was good enough to post in a facebook photography forum..... oh my.....

> "The image isn't level, rubbish."\
> \
> "Go and learn photography"
>
> "There is nothing in the foreground"
>
> "It's like a bad postcard"
>
> "Turn the saturation down in photoshop"
>
> "The sky is so boring"

I was devastated that people didn't love it the way I did. I couldn't understand why they would rip it apart so hard. I stepped away from my desk and went out shooting spider photos to calm down (yes, we all have our peculiarities) and taking photos of jumping spiders is mine.  \
\
All day I couldn't stop thinking about it. Why are they being so harsh ?\
\
So with a fresh set of eyes and a few hours later I decided to look at what had been said. 

* This location means nothing to this group. Without any context or narrative it really could just be a snapshot. 
* The composition isn't the best. There isn't much in the foreground except the My judgement was clouded by why I like the photo, not why others should, would or could. 
* This group can smell the slightest tweak in Lightroom or Photoshop and will distract.

I decided that I could probably demonstrate to the group that I had listened to their suggestions by playing around in photoshop to see if I could tweak it a little. I spotted this amazing little button in Photoshop called "Sky Replacement".  \
\
I tried to explain that this was a hill and I can't level it. I even shared google street view links to convince people to listen to my reasoning.\
\
I picked the sky I liked, and it really drew me into the image a bit more and gave it more depth. I adjusted the hue of the corn to match the sky and cropped it so the foreground was a bit smaller and reposted it.

\
I regretted this attempt shortly after hitting post. I heard facebook ping to enraged posters who decided I was not worthy. 

The feedback I recieved was along the lines of

> \
> "Terrible, why did you use the fake sky"
>
> "The lighting is all wrong"
>
> "It looks like you juct copied and pasted the sky in"
>
> "it's still not level"

## My Eureka moment

\
At this point I decided that whatever I did, this wasn't going to end well. However, something I learned from my day job, is that there is always something good to come from failure. The hard bit was figuring out what.\
\
For me, I realised where it was going wrong. I was trying to make an image for someone else. I wanted people to like my image, but nothing I cared about came across in the image, and why should they. I asked myself why I took the image, and it was to make **me** happy, anyone else was a bonus.\
\
There were some valid points raised, composition, lighting, over saturation etc. but this is where I accepted that I was trying to create an image that wasn't there. So I allowed myself some artistic creativity and combined several images i'd taken over the last few months to create something I was happy with. \
\
I'd not ended up with a photograph, but a composite of all the things that matter to me and I don't think I ever shared it back on the group. I did however accept some fo the feedback to enrich my image.\
\
Later on in this blog i'll talk about the contentious issue of post processing. It gets very ugly, very quickly.

*Image: Composite image of Paulton Batch, Paulton Nr Bristol.*

For me, the final image represented what I was trying to express. Family, colours, nature and the village I'm lucky enough to call home. I don't think I ever shared this image with the group, but I did take away a better appreciation of composition, how even small tweaks can be seen as comprimising on artistic integrity. \
\
When I finally accepted that this image was for me, so much of that no longer mattered. It was an honest representation of what I wanted in an image. The feedback did influence the final image, but the comments didn't dictate it. \
\
The takeaway I wanted to give here is that photography, which is an art, is subjective. Everyoen can have an opinion, and often it's good to dig into why people see it a particular way but trying to make everyone happy leads to comprimise. You must be happy with your work, and doing it for clicks and likes will not end in a happy place. \
\
As i'm hosting all of my images from Flickr, I'm required to share the link back to the Flickr album. \

# Photography Clichés

\
 I would say almost everyone i've come across has been helpful, but unconcious bias does play a massive role. The worst example of this is when you ask the question 

> "What camera should I buy ?"  
>
> \- Every photographer starting out at some point

\
I've seen and been guilty of often giving hypocritical answers. It is very easy to just accept what those who have gone before repeat. That is not a path to successOften I was just parroting photography folk lore to try and make myself feel more like a "proper photographer". This will attract much hate but before you shout at your screen, if you are an experienced photographer ask yourself why you own the equipment you own. 

**Full disclosure:** I am just as guilty of this as anyone else, and this post is part of my penance to all the new photographers.

The answers you will see when you are this question will range from 

> "A good camera doesn't make you a good photographer"
>
> "The best camera is the one you have with you"
>
> "It's what is behind the camera that counts"

While these are all very true statements, and meant with the best intentions they can set the new photographer up for failure, which they don't need early on. Enthusiasm and excitement is everything. It is what makes us get up at 4am to go and get that shot. \
\
A more honest statement would be. 

> "Investing in a good camera isn't necessary at the start, but by investing in a decent camera and glass it is unlikely to make you any worse, and will possibly avoid you realising you've bought into a system that means you'll need to trade your kit in when you decide you want to buy better lenses."

or even

> "Start with an app on your phone that lets you control Aperture, Shutter speed and ISO so you can learn composition and play with the exposure triangle before you invest in an entry level camera that you'll have outgrown in a few years"

It is true, that someone who has spent 20 years doing portraiture photography is going to be able to pick up an entry level camera and do something amazing. They will know what the camera is capable of, they will understand how to get the most from it, they will know how to control the compostion, posing and external lighting to compliment the strengths of that particular camera. \
\
However, that person probably doesn't describe you, there is nothing wrong with that (I still consider myself to be a beginner after 4 years), but it doesn't get you closer to the answer you wanted. Also, consider that if it were true that the camera didn't matter why do people spend thousands on camera bodies and even more on lenses ? 

> "Newer and higher end cameras do provide capabilities that do make a difference" - Me

I can already hear the chants of

> "Camera feature X is cheating, you won't learn how to do it properly"

But with most cameras, whatever the feature is, you can probably turn it off. However if your camera does a better job, why not use it. 

What matters, do you (or will you) need / want those capabilities during the lifetime of your camera. It also raises more questions

* How long do you expect to keep your camera for ? 

As a new photographer, there are only some things you can actually control. Let's work our way through the list. Assuming you have no knowledge of photography, you will need to learn the basics. Personally, I found a combination of just getting out with my camera, and a locla 6 week evening college course really useful. 

* Composition
* Focus
* Focal lengths
* Basic camera and lens care
* Lighting
* Working with people
* Post processing

The lens

The subject

The environment

\
 If you start learning guitar, you usually learn on accoustic. \
They won't help you on day 1, but a massive part of owning a camera is getting to know it. 

I don't say this without personal experience. I started out with a Nikon d5100 and a tamron 18-300 lens (crop sensor). This is a great camera to start with, I learned a lot about the basics of photography. The basic skills I learned were

\=======

This is a valid point, but an important distinction need sot be made. When starting in photography there are 5 thing that really matter. I'll break these down as we go through the post.

1. The photographer
2. The equipment
3. The subject & composition
4. The environment
5. Post processing
